Second Hand Car Price Prediction

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of second-hand cars based on key features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, and more. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the aim is to provide accurate price estimates, helping users make informed decisions when buying or selling used cars.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains features like:

Brand
Model
Year
Fuel Type
Mileage
Engine Power
Transmission Type
Price (Target Variable)
Key Steps in the Project

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the dataset to understand trends, correlations, and distributions.
Visualize key features like brand popularity, price distribution, and fuel type preferences.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical features (e.g., brand, fuel type).
Normalize numerical features for better model performance.
Feature Engineering:
Create new impactful features like age of the car or price per engine power.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Train machine learning models such as:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and 
R

 .
Compare models to identify the best approach.
Visualization:
Scatter plots to compare actual vs predicted prices.
Feature importance plots to understand the impact of different variables.
Technologies Used

Python: Programming language
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
